# Architecture Decision Records

Each file in this folder captures one architecture decision made on the markup-svc codebase, following the standard ADR shape (Status / Context / Decision / Consequences).

New decisions get the next number and a short kebab-case slug:

```
NNNN-short-decision-name.md
```

`scripts/check-adrs.sh` (wired into `make ci-local`) verifies that:

1. Every ADR file is indexed in this README.
2. Every README link points at a file that exists.
3. Every ADR file has a `## Status` line with one of: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`, `Deprecated`.
4. Every ADR file has the four standard sections: `## Status`, `## Context`, `## Decision`, `## Consequences`.
